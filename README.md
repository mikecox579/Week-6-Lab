# Week-7-Lab/Week-6-Lab

This Program takes the user's input for their name, age, and date of birth. It then shows the user a return message with their name, current age, what age they are turning next, and the month followed by the day of their birthday. Also, the program checks to make sure the user entered a dob in the correct format outputing an error message if the format is not correct.

## Miscellany

The reason the MIT license was choosen is because I recognized this license through working with many apis that used this license. Also, permissions, conditions, and limitations match up with what I would actually want if I was creating a real open-source project (specifically the limitation in liability). The reason the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct was choosen is because of it's wide use by major companies, including Google, Mozilla, and Linux. Also, the conduct's coverage in setting standards, resposibilities, and enforcement with additional links to resources with more information.
