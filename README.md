# Week-7-Lab/Week-6-Lab

This Program takes the user's input for their name, age, and date of birth. It then shows the user a return message with their name, current age, what age they are turning next, and the month followed by the day of their birthday. Also, the program checks to make sure the user entered a dob in the correct format outputing an error message if the format is not correct.
